## Usage guide

To make use of this program, first you need to go inside Updater.py and update the variables that are marked with 'required' annotation. 

Second, you need to execute updater.py inside of your main program. Me personally, I execute this program before my main program's UI displays.

Make sure you take a look at the required libraries that this program requires to function properly.
